For this one i helped somone with their project for their class
In here you will see in the notebook how i recolected some datasets for the AI training, then how i turned those images in every dataset to a 100x100 resolution for better porocesing of the images
You will also see how this project manages to recognize the toxic waste aside from the normal trash in almost every case
For the future i plan to upgrade this project to a higher resolution so the model can be trained better on the patterns
I am using a convolutional Red for the training of the model
